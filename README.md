This study compares the Black-Scholes model to the Taylor series approach in option
pricing. We ran a series of tests to assess the accuracy of these two techniques in
forecasting option prices. Our findings show that the Taylor series technique surpasses
the Black-Scholes model in terms of accuracy, particularly for a tiny period of time.
Overall, our work adds to the current debate on the best option pricing approach and
provides important guidance for investors and financial sector practitioners.
